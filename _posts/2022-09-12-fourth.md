Description: First, I had time to think about the purpose of the presentation. Next, I thought about why audience should be considered when presenting. Then, my professor showed me various examples of PowerPoint, and I did activities to find the problems in the PowerPoint. After finding the problems, the professor suggested ways to improve them. After that, I learned about the speed of speech and the manner of the presentation. Next, we learned how to represent graphs' trends and details by looking at various graphs' examples. Finally, I practiced expressing the details and trends of the graph.

Evaluation:
The best thing about this class was that we learned what mistakes we could make when we made PowerPoint. This helped me a lot to improve the quality of the PowerPoint. In finding PowerPoint's common mistakes, I found out about the problems of the PowerPoint that I made recently and felt what to fix. Furthermore, learning to represent trends and details of various graphs helped me analyze graphs. There will be many graphs to analyze in the future in college life. Therefore, this class will have much positive influence on future graph analysis.

Analysis:
It would not have helped me much if I had only found common mistakes while looking at the PowerPoint of various examples. However, the professor gave me a suggestion on how to fix it and gave me advice, so I learned how to make a PowerPoint successfully. Furthermore, after learning how to represent trends and details of graphs by looking at graphs in various examples, we practiced representing graphs. However, I have never expressed a graph in English, so I got confused during practice. Therefore, I asked my partner what I did not know. She kindly analyzed the graph and taught me the words for the graph. Furthermore, she gave me an example of a graph and gave me a problem. Thanks to that, I successfully learned how to represent and analyze graphs.

Conclusion:
This class was beneficial for the upcoming presentation assignment. Through this class, I studied how to make a PowerPoint and explain the graph's trends and details. Therefore, I will not forget and practice more to make a perfect presentation.
